# Grokking coding

This repository is a playbook for coding interviews, covering data structures
and algorithms, recursion, coding patterns, dynamic programming, and more. All
tasks contain descriptions, topics have introductions, and every example is in
Go. The README files provide overviews and usage instructions. Explore each
directory for detailed guidance and practical solutions.
