# Problem 4: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a string, identify the length of its longest segment that contains
distinct characters. In other words, find the maximum length of a substring that
has no repeating characters.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: "abcdaef"
Expected Output: 6
Justification: The longest segment with distinct characters is "bcdaef", which has a length of 6.

Example 2:
Input: "aaaaa"
Expected Output: 1
Justification: The entire string consists of the same character. Thus, the longest segment with
unique characters is just "a", with a length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: "abrkaabcdefghijjxxx"
Expected Output: 10
Justification: The longest segment with distinct characters is "abcdefghij", which has a length of 10.

```

## Constraints

```text
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```
