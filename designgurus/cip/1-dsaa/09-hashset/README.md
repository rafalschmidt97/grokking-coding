# Hash Sets

HashSet is a collection or a group of unique elements.

Characteristics:

- uniqueness
  - in case of duplicates, if you try to add a fruit that is already in the
    basket, it will be ignored.
  - use a hashing function to decide where each element should go.
- null elements
- order - no guarantee
- resizable - when starts to run out of room, they increase the basket size to
  make room for more.

## The Difference at a Glance: HashTable vs. HashSet

- HashTable - key value. Example: key is 'run' and value 'Move fast'
- HashSet - unique collection. Example: just 'run'
