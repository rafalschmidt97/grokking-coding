# Problem 2: Contains Duplicate (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in
the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

```text
Example 1:

Input: nums= [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no duplicates in the given array.
Example 2:

Input: nums= [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: '1' is repeating.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <=10^5
- 10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
