# Problem 2: Largest Unique Number (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, identify the highest value that appears only once in
the array. If no such number exists, return -1.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: [5, 7, 3, 7, 5, 8]
Expected Output: 8
Justification: The number 8 is the highest value that appears only once in the array.

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 4]
Expected Output: 3
Justification: The number 3 is the highest value that appears only once in the array.

Example 3:
Input: [9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7]
Expected Output: -1
Justification: There is no number in the array that appears only once.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= nums.length <= 2000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
```
