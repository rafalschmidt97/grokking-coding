# Problem 3: Maximum Number of Balloons (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given a string, determine the maximum number of times the word "balloon" can be
formed using the characters from the string. Each character in the string can be
used only once.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: "balloonballoon"
Expected Output: 2
Justification: The word "balloon" can be formed twice from the given string.

Example 2:
Input: "bbaall"
Expected Output: 0
Justification: The word "balloon" cannot be formed from the given string as we are missing the character 'o' twice.

Example 3:
Input: "balloonballoooon"
Expected Output: 2
Justification: The word "balloon" can be formed twice, even though there are extra 'o' characters.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= text.length <= 104
text consists of lower case English letters only.
```
