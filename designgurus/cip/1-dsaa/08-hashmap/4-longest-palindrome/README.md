# Problem 4: Longest Palindrome(easy)

## Problem Statement

Given a string, determine the length of the longest palindrome that can be
constructed using the characters from the string. You don't need to return the
palindrome itself, just its maximum possible length.

## Example

```text
1
Input: "applepie"
Expected Output: 5
Justification: The longest palindrome that can be constructed from
the string is "pepep", which has a length of 5. There are are other
palindromes too but they all will be of length 5.

2
Input: "aabbcc"
Expected Output: 6
Justification: We can form the palindrome "abccba" using the characters
from the string, which has a length of 6.

3
Input: "bananas"
Expected Output: 5
Justification: The longest palindrome that can be constructed from the
string is "anana", which has a length of 5.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
```
