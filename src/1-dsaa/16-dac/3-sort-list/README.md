# Sort List (medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a head of the linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending
order.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: [3, 1, 2]
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]
Justification: The list is sorted in ascending order, with 1 coming before 2,
and 2 before 3.

Example 2:
Input: [4]
Expected Output: [4]
Justification: A list with a single element is already sorted.

Example 3:
Input: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Justification: The list is sorted in ascending order, with each element being
smaller than the next.
```

## Constraints

```text
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
```
