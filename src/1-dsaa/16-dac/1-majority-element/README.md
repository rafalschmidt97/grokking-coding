## Problem Statement

Given an array nums having an n elements, identify the element that appears the
majority of the time, meaning more than n/2 times.

## Example

```text

Expected Output: 2
Justification: Here, '2' appears 3 times in a 5-element array, making it
the majority element.

Example 2:
Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4]
Expected Output: 4
Justification: '4' is the majority element as it appears 5 out of 7 times.

Example 3:
Input: [9, 9, 1, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9]
Expected Output: 9
Justification: '9' is the majority element, appearing 5 times in an 8-element array.
```

## Constraints

```text
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```
