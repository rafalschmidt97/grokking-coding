# Problem 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (easy)

Given a sorted linked list, remove all the duplicate elements to leave only
distinct numbers. The linked list should remain sorted, and the modified list
should be returned.

## Problem Statement

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2
Output: 1 -> 2
Justification: Since 1 is repeated, we remove the duplicate to leave a sorted list of unique numbers.
Example 2:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Justification: Here, 2 is the duplicate element, and by removing it, we obtain a list containing only distinct elements.
Example 3:
Input: 3 -> 3 -> 3
Output: 3
Justification: We remove the repeated 3s to leave a single 3 in the list.
```

## Constraints

```text
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
```
