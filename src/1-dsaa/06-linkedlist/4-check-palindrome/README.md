# Problem 4: Find if Doubly Linked List is a Palindrome (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given a doubly linked list, determine whether it is a palindrome.

A doubly linked list is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward,
utilizing the previous and next pointers of the nodes.

## Example

```text
Example 1:

Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1
Output: true
Justification: The list reads the same backward as forward.
Example 2:

Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 2 <-> 3
Output: false
Justification: Reading backward, the list is 3 <-> 2 <-> 2 <-> 1, which is not the same as reading forward.
Example 3:

Input: 1 <-> 1 <-> 1 <-> 1
Output: true
Justification: All elements are the same, so the list is a palindrome.
```
