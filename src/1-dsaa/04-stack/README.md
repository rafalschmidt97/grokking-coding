# Stacks

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order of operation.
This order can either be Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO).

## LIFO

Stacks in data structures operate on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one that gets
taken out.

There are four key operations that you can perform on a stack:

- Push: This is how we add an element to the stack. The element is always added
  to the top. O(1)
- Pop: This is the removal of an element from the stack. The element removed is
  always from the top. O(1)
- Peek or Top: This operation allows us to see the element on the top of the
  stack without removing it. O(1)
- Is Empty: This operation checks if the stack is empty. O(1)

## Implementing Stack Data Structure

- Using an Array
- Using Linked List

## TODO

- Rewrite tasks to use `container/list`
- Reverse string
