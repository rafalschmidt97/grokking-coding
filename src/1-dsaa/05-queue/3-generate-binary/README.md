# Problem 3: Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to N

## Problem Statement

Given an integer N, generate all binary numbers from 1 to N and return them as a
list of strings.

## Example

```text
Examples:

Input: N = 2
Output: ["1", "10"]
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is "1", and the
binary representation of 2 is "10".

Input: N = 3
Output: ["1", "10", "11"]
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is "1",
the binary representation of 2 is "10", and the binary representation of 3 is "11".

Input: N = 5
Output: ["1", "10", "11", "100", "101"]
Explanation: These are the binary representations of the numbers from 1 to 5.
```

## Constraints

```text
none
