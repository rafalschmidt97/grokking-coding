# Problem 4: Palindrome Check using Queue (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given a string, determine if that string is a palindrome using a queue data
structure.

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters that
reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and
capitalization.

## Example

```text
Input: "madam"
Output: True
Explanation: The word "madam" reads the same forwards and backwards.

Input: "openai"
Output: False
Explanation: The word "openai" does not read the same forwards and backwards.

Input: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
Output: True
Explanation: The phrase "A man a plan a canal Panama" reads the same forwards
and backwards when we ignore spaces and capitalization.
```

## Constraints

```text
none
```
