# Solution Walkthrough

Let’s walk through an example to understand how the algorithm works step by
step.

### Example

```plaintext
nums = [1, 2, 4], k = 5
```

We want to maximize the frequency of any element in the array after performing
at most 5 increment operations.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. **Sort the array**:

The first step is to sort the array. In this case, it's already sorted:

```plaintext
nums = [1, 2, 4]
```

#### 2. **Initialize variables**:

- `left = 0`: The left end of our sliding window.
- `sum = 0`: The cumulative sum of elements in the current window.
- `maxFreq = 1`: The initial frequency of the most frequent element is 1.

---

### 3. **Sliding Window Iterations**:

We loop through the array with a `right` pointer (initially set to `0`) and
expand the window.

#### **Iteration 1**: `right = 0`

- Current number: `nums[0] = 1`
- We add this element to `sum`:
  ```plaintext
  sum = 1
  ```
- Now, we check if all elements in the window (just `[1]` for now) can be
  incremented to match `nums[right] = 1` using at most `k = 5` operations.

  - Increments needed:

    ```plaintext
    nums[right] * (right - left + 1) = 1 * (0 - 0 + 1) = 1
    ```

    This is the value we want the elements in the window to match.

  - Check condition:

    ```plaintext
    sum + k = 1 + 5 = 6
    ```

    Since `6 >= 1`, no need to shrink the window.

  - Update:
    ```plaintext
    maxFreq = max(1, 1) = 1
    ```

---

#### **Iteration 2**: `right = 1`

- Current number: `nums[1] = 2`
- Add this element to `sum`:
  ```plaintext
  sum = 1 + 2 = 3
  ```
- Now, the window is `[1, 2]`, and we want to make all elements equal to
  `nums[right] = 2`.

  - Increments needed:

    ```plaintext
    nums[right] * (right - left + 1) = 2 * (1 - 0 + 1) = 4
    ```

  - Check condition:

    ```plaintext
    sum + k = 3 + 5 = 8
    ```

    Since `8 >= 4`, we can increment the elements in the window to match `2`.

  - Update:
    ```plaintext
    maxFreq = max(1, 2) = 2
    ```

---

#### **Iteration 3**: `right = 2`

- Current number: `nums[2] = 4`
- Add this element to `sum`:
  ```plaintext
  sum = 3 + 4 = 7
  ```
- Now, the window is `[1, 2, 4]`, and we want to make all elements equal to
  `nums[right] = 4`.

  - Increments needed:

    ```plaintext
    nums[right] * (right - left + 1) = 4 * (2 - 0 + 1) = 12
    ```

  - Check condition:

    ```plaintext
    sum + k = 7 + 5 = 12
    ```

    Since `12 == 12`, this is possible, so no need to shrink the window.

  - Update:
    ```plaintext
    maxFreq = max(2, 3) = 3
    ```

---

### Final Result

After the loop finishes, the maximum frequency we can achieve is:

```plaintext
maxFreq = 3
```

This means we can make three elements in the array equal to the same value with
at most `5` increment operations.

Thus, the output is:

```plaintext
Output: 3
```

### Conclusion

By the end of the process, we’ve used the sliding window approach to maximize
the frequency of the most frequent element. Here’s how the increments work:

- Increment `1` to `2`, which takes 1 operation.
- Increment `2` to `4`, which takes 2 operations.
- Increment `1` to `4`, which takes 2 operations.

Thus, `[1, 2, 4]` becomes `[4, 4, 4]`, and the number `4` appears three times.
