# Sqrt (medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the
nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x \*\* 0.5 in python.

## Example

```text

Example 1:
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.8284, and since we need to
return the floor of the square root (integer), hence we returned 2.

Example 2:
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.

Example 3:
Input: x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The square root of 2 is 1.414, and since we need
to return the floor of the square root (integer), hence we returned 1.

```

## Constraints

```text
0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```
