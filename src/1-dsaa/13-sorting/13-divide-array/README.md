# Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference (medium)

## Problem Statement

You are given an array nums containing n integers and a positive integer k.

Divide the nums into arrays of size 3 such that it satisfies the below
conditions:

Each element of nums should be in exactly one array. The difference between any
two elements of a single array should be less than or equal to k. Return a 2D
array of these subarrays. If no such division is possible, return an empty
array.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 6, 5, 9, 3, 7, 3, 4, 1], k = 3
Expected Output: [[1,2,3],[3,4,4],[6,7,9]]
Explanation: The three groups [1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 4] and [6, 7, 9] all have
elements with differences â‰¤ k. For the group [1, 2, 3] the maximum difference
between elements is 2. For the group [3, 4, 4], the maximum difference is 1,
and for [6, 7, 9], it's 3, all of which satisfy the condition.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30], k = 10
Expected Output: [[10, 12, 15], [20, 25, 30]]
Explanation: Here, the two groups have maximum differences of 5 and 10 respectively,
which are less than or equal to k, thus meeting the criteria perfectly.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10], k = 1
Expected Output: []
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the nums in subarrays as the value of
the k is equal to 1.
```

## Constraints

```text
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
n is a multiple of 3.
```
