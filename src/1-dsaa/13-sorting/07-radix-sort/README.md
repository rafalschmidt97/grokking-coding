Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that **sorts numbers digit by
digit starting from the least significant digit** to the most significant digit.
Radix sort uses counting sort as an intermediate sorting method to sort digits.
Because it processes individual digits, it can handle large numbers efficiently,
provided the digits are uniformly distributed.
