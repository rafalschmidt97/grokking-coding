# Sorting

## Terminologies in Sorting

- Stability: A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of
  equivalent elements from the original list.
- In-place Sorting: An in-place sorting algorithm rearranges the elements within
  the array, using only a small, constant amount of additional storage space.
- Comparison Sort: A type of sort that determines the sorted order based on
  comparisons between the input elements.
- Non-comparison Sort: Sorting techniques that do not rely on element comparison
  and typically work with integer keys by grouping and counting elements.
