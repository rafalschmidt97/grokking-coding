# Valid Palindrome II (easy)

## Problem Statement

Given string s, determine whether it's possible to make a given string
palindrome by removing at most one character.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.

## Example

```text
Example 1:
Input: "racecar"
Expected Output: true
Justification: The string is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.

Example 2:
Input: "abccdba"
Expected Output: true
Justification: Removing the character 'd' forms the palindrome "abccba".

Example 3:
Input: "abcdef"
Expected Output: false
Justification: No single character removal will make this string a palindrome.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= s.length <= 1^05
str consists of lowercase English letters.
```
