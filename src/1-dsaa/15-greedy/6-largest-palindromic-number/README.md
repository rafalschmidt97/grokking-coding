# Largest Palindromic Number (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a string s containing 0 to 9 digits, create the largest possible
palindromic number using the string characters.

A palindromic number reads the same backward as forward.

If it's not possible to form such a number using all digits of the given string,
you can skip some of them.

## Example

```text
1.
  Input: "323211444"
  Expected Output: "432141234"
  Justification: This is the largest palindromic number that can be
formed from the given digits.

2.
  Input: "998877"
  Expected Output: "987789"
  Justification: "987789" is the largest palindrome that can be formed.

3.
  Input: "54321"
  Expected Output: "5"
  Justification: Only "5" can form a valid palindromic number as
other digits cannot be paired.
```

## Constraints

```text
1 <= num.length <= 10^5
num consists of digits.
```
